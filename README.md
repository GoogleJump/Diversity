Our app is called SolveNGo. The objective of the game is to collect all the items that belong to a character that the user chooses.
The user solves riddles and anagrams to gain access to the locations of the materials that are combined to make an item.
Material locations (up to five) are revealed on the map, and the user must travel to the location in order to collect that material. 
Once all the materials for an item are collected, the materials are combined to create an item. 
If the user completes all the items for a character, they get a special prize.
